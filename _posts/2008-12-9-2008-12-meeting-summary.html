<p>Wow! A lot of people and a lot of great discussions. I want every WRUG meeting to be like that! Looked like it even helped some people break their mental language barrier.</p>

<p>Presentations that took place, of course downloadable:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mike Lee</b> - <a href="/assets/2009/1/7/2008DEC.pdf">Test By Proxy</a>: A tour of a flexible way to get monitoring, logging and testing fully automated</li>
<li><b>Tomek Stachewicz</b> - <a href="/assets/2009/1/6/2008-12-advanced_ruby.pdf">Advanced Ruby round-up</a>: Meta-programming, functional goodies and all the other stuff in Ruby that seems magic and daunting at first</li>
</ul>
